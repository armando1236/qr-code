## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project was good for practicing how to center objects, using margins and padding, and aligning objects. 





### Continued development

Although I feel good about how the project came out, I still need to improve my CSS skills. I had some trouble aligning the qr image. I thought that using auto for the left and right margins would center the image and I would just have to input custom margins for the top and bottom. This did not work. I ended up with different margins for each side inorder to center the image within the div. I'm also not sure if using a span to edit part of the bottom text was the best method instead of doing a sperate p tag with a unique class. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for any questions I had regarding margins and padding. 
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used this site for syntax examples and anything else I got stuck on.
